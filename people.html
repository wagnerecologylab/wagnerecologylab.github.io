      <p class="card-text">
          I  completed my BSc in Biological Sciences and MSc in Ecology and Limnology at the State University of Maringá, Brazil. 
       My research project focuses on comparing 
       the levels of alien plant invasion across habitats of the Alberta prairie in order to find similarities among the impacted habitats. 
       These results will contribute to a solid theoretical framework applicable to conservation efforts and risk assessment across ecosystems. 
       In my free time, my other interests include outdoor activities, fitness and occasional gaming.

       I  obtained a master’s degree from the University of Göttingen and carried out my doctoral research on saline and brackish grasslands of the Baltic Sea coast (Northern Europe) at the University of Hildesheim in cooperation with the University of Göttingen. 
       I am interested in plant diversity patterns and research driven conservation management of natural and semi-natural open landscapes. 
       As postdoc in the Wagner Ecology lab, I analyse the plant diversity, ecology and distribution of montane bedrock meadows.

       I am studying levels of non-native plant invasion along a latitudinal gradient of native prairie grassland in Alberta, Canada. 
       Field data will be analyzed to determine the role of climate and anthropogenic disturbance as predictors of invasibility in prairie grassland. 
       Prior to starting graduate studies, I worked in environmental consulting and government, and I earned my Professional Agrologist (P.Ag.) designation in 2018.

		  Our department is equipped with greenhouses and the University operates field
		  stations in southern Alberta. Basic soil and plant analyses can be performed in
		  the lab. More elaborate analyses can be carried out at other University facilities
		  (NRAL, BASL).
		  The city of Edmonton hosts a large depository of vascular plant, bryophyte, lichen and entomological specimens
		  (U Alberta museums, the Royal Alberta Museum, the U Alberta Botanical Garden).
		  The city is situated in a transition between the temporate and boreal zones (“Gateway of the North”).
		  The North American prairie (in the south) and the Rocky Mountains (further west) are just 3h away by car.
