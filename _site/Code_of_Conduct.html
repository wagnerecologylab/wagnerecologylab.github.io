<br>

<strong>Equity, diversity & inclusion</strong><br>
• The Wagner Ecology lab is a place where members can grow in a supportive and inclusive environment, irrespective of ethnicity, gender, body appearance, religious beliefs, family or marital status, age, or colour. <br>
• By joining our group, researchers, students, and volunteers pledge to contribute to a respectful and positive lab environment, to uphold ethical standards, and to adhere to health and environmental safety procedures.
<br><br>


<strong>Lab social environment</strong><br>
• We contribute to a positive, welcoming, and respectful social environment, and to be mindful about language and behaviour.<br>
• Our main workplace and most of our field locations are located on Treaty 6 territory. We respect the histories, languages, and cultures of First Nations, Metis, Inuit, and all First Peoples of Canada, whose presence continues to enrich our vibrant community.<br>
• Our work would not be possible without public funding. Lab members are expected to give back by disseminating knowledge to the public, through scientific papers, conference presentations, and public outreach.<br>
• We are part of a community and support each other whenever we can and we acknowledge the help of our lab members in our presentations, research reports, or papers.<br>
• We share data among each other and are open to sharing data with other scientists.<br>
• We avoid creating obstacles for fellow lab members by keeping shared workspaces clean after finishing a batch of work.<br>
• We keep sensitive information confidential.<br>
• We do not tolerate any harassment, including prejudice, gossiping, or abusive language/behaviour. <br>
• Lab members who are feeling harassed can reach out the PI, lab members they trust, or reach out to the UofA Office of Safe Disclosure & Human Rights <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/provost/portfolio/office-of-safe-disclosure-human-rights1.html">here</a>.
<br><br>


<strong>Ethical standards</strong><br>
• We adhere to academic integrity, are truthful in our conduct, and do not plagiarize.<br>
• We secure permits when conducting fieldwork in protected areas, private properties, First Nation reserves, and Metis settlements.<br>
• We treat local communities, including First Nations, Metis, and Inuit, and the environment with great respect and, if appropriate, reach out to local communities to inform them about out work.
<br><br>

<strong>Health and environmental safety</strong><br>
• The health of lab members and the safety of the environment are a key priority in our lab. <br>
• We participate in annual lab safety training provided by the University and adhere to the rules set in the lab standard operating procedures. <br>
• Prior to any fieldwork, graduate students, undergraduate research students, and post-docs prepare field action plans. All lab members take safety training (e.g. bear and cougar safety, first aid). <br>
• We avoid risky behaviour in the lab and in the field, and only perform work that we feel comfortable doing. <br>
• We do our share to protect the environment. When working with soil and plant material from abroad, we secure import permits and adhere to the respective safety operating procedures.<br>
