          <p>We are a plant community ecology lab at the Department of Biological Sciences, at the University of Alberta, Canada.<br><br>
          We aim to understand why habitats become susceptible to invasive non-native plants and how management 
          actions, human pressure and environmental factors affect their biological components. 
          In the era of global change, we try to illuminate the biodiversity and functions of rare habitats that have been poorly studied. <br><br>
          We work across different habitat types but much of our work focuses on grasslands. These ecosystems cover a quarter of the 
          global terrestrial surface but face unprecedented and enormous pressure by farming, 
          non-native species, a disruption of natural disturbance regimes, and climate change. <br><br>
          Our research centres on western Canada, the adjacent US states, Europe and Central Asia and
			we tackle our research questions through a comparative framework and data mining, field observations, and experiments.
