          <p>We are a recently formed lab Department of Biological Sciences, at the University of Alberta, Canada. <br><br>
          We work in the fields of plant ecology and ecoinformatics and aim to understand 
          why habitats become susceptible to invasive non-native plants, how management 
          actions affect their biological components, and try to illuminate their biodiversity and ecological functions. <br><br>
          Much of our work focuses on grasslands. These habitats cover a quarter of the 
          global terrestrial surface but face unprecedented and enormous pressure by farming, 
          non-native species, a disruption of natural disturbance regimes, and climate change. <br><br>
          We work in western Canada and the adjacent US states but have also ties to Europe and Central Asia.
			We tackle our research questions through a comparative framework across continents 
			and habitats and a diverse toolbox that includes data mining, field observations, and experiments.
			<br><br>
			To find out more about the lab and 
			potential opportunities, please explore our recent Publications, check out our 
			sites on Research and Opportunities, or contact the PI, Viktoria Wagner.</p>
