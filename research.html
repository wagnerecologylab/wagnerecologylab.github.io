    <h5 class="card-title">1. Habitat susceptibility to non-native plants</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
      	<p>An increasing number of studies has shown that plant communities respond differently to disturbance 
      	and non-native plants; some buffer them while maintaining native plant composition, while others appear 
      	to collapse under pressure. We use data mining, field  observations and experiments to explore the levels 
      	of invasion across habitats and to identify the mechanisms that drive habitat invasibility.
