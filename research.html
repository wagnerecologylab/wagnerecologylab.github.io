      <p class="card-text">
      	<p>An increasing number of studies has shown that plant communities respond differently to disturbance 
      	and non-native plants; some buffer them while maintaining native plant composition, while others appear 
      	to collapse under pressure. We use data mining, field  observations and experiments to explore the levels 
      	of invasion across habitats and to identify the mechanisms that drive habitat invasibility.

    <h5 class="card-title">2. Non-native species invasiveness</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        <p>Biotic exchange is a major driver of ecosystem transformation across the globe. In Canada, 26% of the flora is comprised of non-native taxa. Although most non-native plants occur infrequently and in low abundances, some species become invasive by spreading into natural habitat, outcompeting native plants, decreasing biodiversity, and altering ecological functioning. Our research investigates the invasiveness and impacts of non-native plant species in central Canada. We currently focus on agronomic grasses that are invasive in prairie grasslands and the introduced nitrogen-fixing shrub <em>Caragana arborescens</em>, which is spreading in southern boreal forests.

      <p class="card-text">
        <p>Historically, bison was a key dispersal vector for seeds owing to its large herd numbers and long-distance migration. Today, the role of bison has been replaced by cattle, which due to their high density play an equally important role. In our research on seed dispersal in the dry mixedgrass prairie, we aim to understand what plant species benefit from cattle dung and wind dispersal and how these dispersal vectors filter the species pool in the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank. We collaborate with the <a href="https://cat-g.ca">Climate ACtion Through Grazing (CAT-G) project</a> in a study that investigates how grazing regimes modify seed dispersal and test how dung and soil crusts shape the soil seed bank.<br>
